#Project Overview


This Learning Management System (LMS) is a web platform that helps manage educational courses and resources. 
Educators can easily create and share course materials, while students can access lessons, submit assignments, and track their progress.
Built with Django, the project includes features like user authentication, role-based access, and simple dashboards for both teachers and students.
